About Fine Alley
----------------

Unfortunately, we regret to inform everyone that Fine Alley will no longer be performing as group for the forceable future.  We would like to thank our fans for coming out and supporting us over the last 3 years.  We have had a blast performing for you!

Fine Alley was a band centrally located in Midland, Ontario and provided live music entertainment for Simcoe County and the surrounding area. We played rock music from the 70's, 90's, and some of today's modern hits.
